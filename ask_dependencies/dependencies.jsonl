This may involve checking that `start` is less than or equal to `stop` for ascending and `start` is greater than or equal to `stop` for descending.\n\n5. `get_sequence_length(start: int, stop: int, step: int) -> int`: This function is used to calculate the total number of elements that will be yielded by the generator based on the starting point, stopping point, and stepping value. This could help in optimizing resource usage or for any boundary conditions.\n\n6. `yield_roman_number(roman: str)`: This function is used as a wrapper around the `yield` keyword, managing how Roman numeral strings are yielded from the generator. This may also include any additional features, such as logging or managing state across yields.\n\n7. `log_invalid_input(param_name: str, value: Any)`: This function is used to log errors or invalid input values for parameters, helping in the debugging process and allowing developers to understand why certain inputs failed validation checks."}
