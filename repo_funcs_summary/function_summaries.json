The compression effectiveness is influenced by the size of the input string and its content characteristics, with more significant compression typically occurring in longer strings with repeating character sequences. It leverages the standard Python libraries `zlib` and `base64` to achieve this functionality, and it allows users to specify encoding and a compression level ranging from 0 (no compression) to 9 (maximum compression). If the input string is empty, a `ValueError` is raised."
