It first verifies that the string is not empty and matches a shallow pattern of an IPv4 address using a regular expression. Then, it splits the string by the dot (`.`) delimiter and checks that each segment is an integer within the valid range of 0 to 255. If all segments are valid, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`."

The function relies on a regular expression (`IP_V6_RE`) to validate the format of the input string, ensuring it conforms to the IPv6 address structure. Additionally, it checks that the input string is not empty or incomplete using the `is_full_string` function."

The function allows for optional parameters to ignore spaces and/or case sensitivity when checking for palindromes. If `ignore_spaces` is set to `True`, any spaces in the string are removed before the check. If `ignore_case` is set to `True`, the function compares characters in a case-insensitive manner. The function returns `True` if the string is a palindrome under the specified conditions, and `False` otherwise."

The function first checks if the input string is a full string (non-empty and not just whitespace).

The function checks this by comparing the length of the string to the length of the set of characters in the string. If they are equal, it means all characters are unique, and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`. The function also ensures that the input is a non-empty string before performing the check."

A slug is a string that consists of lowercase alphanumeric characters and hyphens (or a specified separator), with no spaces or special characters. The function uses a regular expression to validate the input string against the slug format, ensuring it starts and ends with alphanumeric characters and only contains the specified separator in between. If the string matches the slug pattern, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`."

The function is designed to handle strings with punctuation, ensuring that words separated by punctuation (e.g., \"one,two,three.stop\") are counted correctly. If the input is not a valid string, the function raises an `InvalidInputError`. The function returns the total count of words found in the input string."
